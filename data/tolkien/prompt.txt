Write in the style of J.R.R. Tolkien, moving the action to middle earth (making sure that no technology / clothes / job is too recent for the settings).
Replace the characters with appropriate Tolkien's characters (ensuring their description, job description and relationships are accurate).
Avoid repetitions in your descriptions.
